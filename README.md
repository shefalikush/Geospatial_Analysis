# Geospatial_Analysis
##This project is about analyzing the taxi trip data by performing geospatial analysis to derive meaningful insights. These analyses will help to identify hotspots, detect high density areas of trips, popular pickup /drop off 
areas by data visualizations , trip efficiencies by comparing trip distance to straight line, spatial 
patterns and nearby pickup and drop up area. This analysis can be used to solve real -world 
problems like traffic control and demand forecasting. 

It includes the usage of data visualization techniques like folium and leaflet maps to understand the high 
traffic areas, common routes, nearby zones, and high demands at a particular time.
